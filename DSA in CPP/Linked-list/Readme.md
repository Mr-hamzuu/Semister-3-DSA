# Data Structures Using Linked Lists (C++)

This repository contains multiple implementations of data structures built using linked lists.  
The goal of this project is to provide clean, easy-to-understand implementations of various linked list–based structures commonly taught in Data Structures courses.

The repository includes:

- Singly Linked List  
- Doubly Linked List  
- Circular Linked List  
- Stack using Linked List  
- Linear Queue using Linked List

## Contents / Topics Covered

### 1. Singly Linked List
- Node structure
- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert at a specific position
- Delete from beginning
- Delete from end
- Delete at position
- Search for an element
- Count nodes
- Display list
- Reverse list
- Memory handling

---

### 2. Doubly Linked List
- Node with previous and next pointers
- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert at position
- Delete from beginning
- Delete from end
- Delete at position
- Forward traversal
- Backward traversal
- Search
- Memory cleanup

---

### 3. Circular Linked List
- Last node pointing back to head
- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert at position
- Delete from beginning
- Delete from end
- Circular traversal
- Search
- Handling one-node circular list

---

### 4. Stack Using Linked List
- Push operation
- Pop operation
- Peek/top
- Stack underflow handling
- Display stack
- Dynamic memory usage (no size limit)

---

### 5. Linear Queue Using Linked List
- Enqueue (insert at rear)
- Dequeue (delete from front)
- Peek/front element
- Underflow handling
- Display queue
- Efficient O(1) operations using front & rear pointers
